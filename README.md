# GraphLib

Welcome to jGraphLib!!

jGraphLib is a small library to work with Directed Graphs. It provides a representation for Graphs, Nodes, Arcs and some methods to transverse the Graph. Between the funny things you can do with this library there is one algorithm that is really cool: The Minimum Hitting Set, that jGraphLib also provides an implementation.
