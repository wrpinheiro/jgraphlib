<h1>GraphLib</h1>

Welcome to jGraphLib!!

jGraphLib is a small library to work with Direct Acyclic Graphs. It provides
a representation for Graphs, Nodes, Arcs and some methods to transverse the
Graph. Between the funny things we can do with this library there is one
algorithm that is really cool: The Minimum Hitting Set, that jGraphLib also
provides an implementation.
